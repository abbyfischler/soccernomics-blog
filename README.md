# Soccernomics Reading Blog

For my capstone project, I am combining my 2 passions: soccer and technology. I am doing this by learning about womens soccer at a collegiate level and making data anyalitcs. I'm starting this process by reading the book Soccernomics (2018 World Cup Edition): Why England Loses, Why Germany and Brazil Win, and Why the U.S., Japan, Australia, Turkey -- and Even Iraq -- Are Destined to Become the Kings of the World's Most Popular Sport." by by Simon Kuper, Stefan Szymanski. This website is a blog of my notes and data analytics I have made based on my findings.
