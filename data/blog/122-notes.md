- “Some studies showed that the stadium would make taxpayers rich.” (258)
- “Bada examined data such as income pere head and the numbers of new business and jobs created in various cities.” “All this spending was evidently producing no benefit.” (261)
- Ex: German world cup
-- Hosts didn’t make much money
- “Hosting sports tournaments doesn’t increase the numbers of tourists or full-time jobs, or the total economic growth.” (264)
- “Almost all the research points in one direction: hosting doesn’t create an economic bonanza.” (265)
- Sports tournaments almost always cost more than forecast (268)
- Age, sex, and social status matters too in happiness data (272)
- “Women seem to be happier than men, which might help explain their much lower rates of suicide.” (273)
- “Staging a world cup won’t make you  rich, but it does tend to cheer you up.”(273)
- “After a country hosts a soccer tournament, its inhabitants report increased happiness.” (273)
- Of all the subgroups we studied, only one a (significant one) did not get any happier: women. (275)
- “Moreover, hosting can boost the nation’s self-esteem, and so makes people feel better about themselves.” (277)
This chapter didn’t talk about match analysis rather it talked about happiness data. It was a fun chapter to read and very happy and upbeat!
