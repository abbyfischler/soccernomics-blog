- The book recognizes there are so- called systematic failures
- Page 34 quote
-- Data analytic on minutes played by seniors for 2022?
- Teams offer relocation services for players
- When a new manager is hired it happens shortly after the original manager was fired
-- It's typically a phone call rather than an extensive process
-- “The new manager is traditionally chosen not for his alleged managerial skills but because his name, appearance, and skills at public relations are expected to impress the club’s fans, its players, and the media.
- Page 73 is of interest; it talks about why the clubs haven’t taken interest in using data and new ways.
-- It states “most soccer clubs are packed with people who have always done things the old way. So everyone keeps doing the same things they have down forever, even if those things have never particularly worked”
- “The only way to win matches was to overspend” page 78
