This chapter didn't talk about match / player statistics. It was about American football vs football. It talked about viewership numbers and TV deals. Nonetheless, here are some notes / things I found interesting:

-   1890s oxford coined "soccer" (280)

-   Soccer spread football didn't spread 281

-   The US does have a strong soccer culture (286)

-   "Attendance" in some cases is tracked by tickets sold (287)

-   There is a funny Twitter account showing how empty the MLS is called @emptyseatsMLS

-   The US most watched soccer game in history is a women's match.

-   2015 WC game vs japan. (288)

-   "The Premier League punishes failure while the NFL rewards it." (293)

-   "Fans are surprisingly good at losing." (296)

-   "Fans enjoy unbalanced modern soccer." (300)
