- When brazil gets knocked out of a World Cup, Brazillians jump off apartment blocks (241)

The chapter mainly talks about the correlation between suicides and soccer games. It found taht more deaths occur during the world cup. Furthermore, it went on to discuss the impact that tournaments have on men: increase drinking which can lead to domestic violence. The chapter ends raising an interesting point: “Either we encourage socially responsible consumption(e.g.,, alcohol and cigarettes) or we ban the thing(narcotics). We think sports should go for social responsibility.” (255)
