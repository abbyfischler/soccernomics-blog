# November 7th Notes

_General Notes:_

- It's odd how many of the same inefficiencies exist in soccer
- blonde players tend to stand out

## "This is an example of the so-called availability heuristic: the more a avaible a piece of information is to the memory, the more likely it is to influence your decision, even when the information is irrelevant. Signing these shooting stars fits what Moneyball calls " a tendency to be overly influenced by a guy's most recent performance: what he did last was not necessarily what he would do next."

The chapter mainly talks about trading / british soccer economics. for example it talks about when a team brings in a new manager possible things he/she does. it also focuses on the transfer market (page 24)

overall this chapter is not really applicable to my project in data analytics but increased my knowledge of trading and soccer.
