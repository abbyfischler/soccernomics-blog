# November 7th Notes

_General Notes:_

- It's odd how many of the same inefficiencies exist in soccer
- blonde players tend to stand out

## "This is an example of the so-called availability heuristic: the more a avaible a piece of information is to the memory, the more likely it is to influence your decision, even when the information is irrelevant. Signing these shooting stars fits what Moneyball calls " a tendency to be overly influenced by a guy's most recent performance: what he did last was not necessarily what he would do next."

The chapter mainly talks about trading / british soccer economics. for example it talks about when a team brings in a new manager possible things he/she does. it also focuses on the transfer market (page 24)

# Bar chart showing players with the most minutes based on hair color

- in the book it mentioned how coaches scout more blondes as they are easier to find on the field. i decided to make a chart showing members playing time based on hair color.
